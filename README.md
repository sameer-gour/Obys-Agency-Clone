# Obys Agency Clone

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my attempt at cloning the [Obys Agency](https://obys.agency/) website. I built it to practice **responsive design, animations, and interactive UI**.  

---

## Whatâ€™s in it

- Fully **responsive** for desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- **Smooth scrolling** using Locomotive Scroll  
- Fun **animations** with GSAP  
- Trying to match the **look and feel** of the original site  

---

## Tech I used

- HTML, CSS (Flexbox & Grid)  
- JavaScript  
- GSAP for animations  
- Locomotive Scroll

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obys-agency-clone.git
